# decision-trees
This code loads and preprocesses a dataset from a CSV file, filters out missing values, and calculates statistical metrics. It splits the data into training and testing sets, trains a decision tree classifier, and evaluates its accuracy and recall. The code also determines the optimal complexity parameter (ccp_alpha) for pruning to avoid overfitting and identifies the most important feature influencing the model's predictions. To run the script, ensure there is a dataset named DT.csv and is in the same directory. The output displays statistical analysis, model performance metrics, optimal pruning parameters, and feature importance of the decision tree classifier.
